These pages show you how to get up and running as quickly as possible with Gate.

If you are new to Gate, start with [Installation]({{< relref "./Installation/_index.md" >}}), to get Gate. 

The [Getting Started]({{< relref "./Getting Started/_index.md" >}}) section will have your 
first Gate proxy up and running, and then have you connect Minecraft servers after that.
